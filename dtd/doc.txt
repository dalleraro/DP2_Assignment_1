DESCRIPTION OF THE DTD

The main element is called workflow_info, and can contain an arbitrary number
of workflow, process and actor elements.

A workflow element contains one or more action elements and as a "name" attribute,
which is its unique identifier.

An action can contain either one simple_action or one process_action element,
the first one containing an optional list of references to action names as an attribute, 
the second one the reference to a workflow name, always as an attribute.
Actions are also characterized by three attributes: a "name", a "role" and "automInst", 
the last one can assume two values "true" or "false" ("false" is the default), telling if
the action is automatically instantiated.

An actor is an empty element and has three attributes: an "ID", a "name" and a "role".
The ID is computed as the hash of the name and the role combined, this allows the unambiguous
identification of an actor inside an action_execution.

A process contains a sequence of action_execution elements (zero or many) and the reference to
the workflow ID is included as an attribute, as well as the start date.

An action_execution, similarly to actor, is an empty element with three attributes:
the name of the executed action, the idref of the actor in charge and the termination time.
"actor" and "termination time" are optional, so that if they are missing this means that the action
is not taken in charge and not terminated.
